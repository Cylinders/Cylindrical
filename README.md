# Cylindrical
A fully custom compiled networking programming language

The language has the ability to be controlled: 


You, as the programmer, decide whether or not the language will be lazily evaluated, or strictly evaluated. 

You, as the programmer, decide whether or not the language will be garbage collected or manually memory managed.

As of right now, the language is purely theoretical and is not designed for true effective application use.

The program was built WITHOUT LLVM: 

Consider that to be an advantage: 

Less overhead and hence faster compile times.
